This is the source code for my portfolio website, https://rhorvath.info/

I've opted for a pretty standard file structure, separating CSS, Javascript, and media elements. I've also created a folder to house html documents that exclude the home page (index.html). Feel free to visit the website to contact me or check out my other work.
