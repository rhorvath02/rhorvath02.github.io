                <p>
                    The steering system is the driver's interface with the tires. Therefore, we need to design a system that maintains
                    functionality through the additional DOF. I've helped maintain consistency by minimizing bump steer before
                    doing any additional work (I'll add a 2D sketch of the kinematics at a later date). Now we need to focus on our two
                    primary factors: maximizing driver comfort and maximizing the grip of the tires.

                <p>
                    A large part of maximizing grip of the tires is Ackermann selection. Before we begin, we need to ask a few questions:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. What state of the car do we design for?
                    <br>
                    2. How do we make our design robust to changes in vehicle state?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've approached these questions below and detailed the entire selection/design process.

                <h2> Tire Loading: </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important elements to consider here is tire loading. Fz has a drastic effect on Fx and Fy,
                    so I'm going to start by defining the normal loads we want to design around. In order to find these normal
                    loads, I need to find representative accelerations and velocity. To do this, I've generated a GGV using UT's
                    MMM implementation. I then calculated the frequency of points within that GGV and put this into a 2D format.
                    I'm going to analyze the four highest frequency points, and I've pulled the range of velocities at which each
                    point occurs (max and min values). This will give me 8 conditions to check. I've Included a picture of the
                    frequency plot to the right.

                <p>
                    I'm using the following points from the frequency plot: (1.67, 0.24), (1.67, -0.05), (1.67, -0.98), (1.67, -1.05).
                    Their respective min and max velocities are: (18.03, 22.19), (11.55, 27.6), (11.6, 13.14), (13.1, 17.76). Note that
                    the accelerations are in gs, and the velocities are in m/s. I'm now using these 8 conditions and putting them into
                    our loading spreadsheet to get the forces at the tires. Note that every force in the table is in Newtons.

                    I've generated graphs of Fy vs SA for each tire below. Note that the lighter, multicolored lines are the exact
                    loading conditions for each tire, and the black lines are the result of the trimmed mean. I realize that using a
                    trimmed mean may not be the best metric for this, but the peak Fy on the black lines looks very similar to
                    that seen across the other normal loads.

                    These plots also highlight how our Fy reaches a near maximum at lower SA for lower Fz. For instance, the peak
                    for our front inner tire (using the trimmed mean) lies on a relatively horizontal line segment; we get a very
                    similar lateral force for a large range of SA, starting around 7.5 deg. For this reason, I will take optimal
                    SA for the inner tires as the lowest SA that still corresponds to a peak (at any Fz). This greatly increases Fy
                    at higher Fz and has a slightly negative effect at lower Fz, but the gain at higher loads is greater in magnitude, 
                    and this makes performance less sensitive to Fz.

                    Our Ackermann selection directly influences the front slip angles, so I will only focus on the front tires for now.
                    Based on the previous paragraph, I will select the optimal inner slip angle as 10.625 deg and the optimal outer slip
                    angle as 11.875 deg. Also, note that I took values from the GGV earlier based on frequency. I've now gone back and
                    pulled the average radius across our sampled points, and I will use this value for the Ackermann calculation. This
                    radius is 14.102 meters.

                <p>
                    I now have a set of targets to design around. I need my inner SA to be 10.625 deg, I need my outer SA to be 
                    11.875 deg, and I'm designing with a 14.102m radius turn in mind. I'm now going to take these values, make
                    a mockup of our 2023 concept vehicle in a 2D sketch, and analyze this sketch going forward.

                    I've included the applicable 2D sketch to the right. I set a radius of 14.102m at the CG, then I drew concentric
                    circles concident with the inner and outer tires. From here I drew tangents to the inner and outer circles,
                    defined SA, and took the angles between each wheel and the normal to the track (steered angle). This gives us our
                    two steered angles and therefore our Ackermann percent. Inner: 14.05 deg, outer: 15 deg, Ackermann: -6.76%.

                    I've now modified the longitudinal position of the outboard tie rod mounts to reflect this Ackermann percent. The
                    inner tire angle is 14.05 deg, and the outer tire angle is 14.99 deg at 56.25 deg of steered angle. Now that I've
                    set the Ackermann percent, I need to check physical limitations regarding rules requirements (minimum turn radius).

                <p>
                    FSAE rules specify that we must be able to complete a 4.5m radius turn. In order to check this condition, I need
                    to find the max tire angles allowable by linkage clearance (control arms and tie rods). Note that the Ackermann
                    percent above will influence the max possible tire angles.

                    After iterating through our dynamic reference sketch and checking CAD assemblies, I found that the max allowable
                    wheel angles are 23.83 deg inner and 26.13 deg outer (under max heave/roll), occurring at 95 deg steered angle.
                    Now we need to verify whether these angles allow us to complete our required minimum turn radius. I've created
                    a new 2D sketch and mapped the IC, assuming a velocity low enough that no slip angles develop (worst case).

                    From the 2D sketch, we see that our minimum attainable turn radius is 167.72 in, or 4.26 m. Therefore, this
                    specific steering design seems valid from a rules standpoint as well.

                    Now I want to look at our expectations for the driver. We need our system to enable drivers to perform at their best,
                    and steering effort is important when assessing the comfort of our design. For this analysis, I will disregard friction
                    due to bearings and bushings. In essence, I'll look at tire forces (use these to find forces in the tie rods) and
                    aligning moment.

                    The max force in our tie rods is current 200 lbf (done during suspension analyis), and I'm confident that the force
                    contribution from aligning moment has a larger impact on steering effort. I'll start with this assumption and come
                    back if my process seems to show otherwise.

                    My current plan is to find a normal load I want to analyze and use the discrete FZ slice that works best
                    for that target FZ. To select this FZ, I want to get the combination of FZ and SA that has the highest
                    possible aligning moment (this will give a worst case steering effort). To do this I've taken the GGV
                    sweep from earlier and plotted FZ vs SA for the front tires. I've included this plot to the right:

                    When looking at the MZ vs SA plots from the TTC, I notice a couple of details. First, all of the peaks occur well
                    within 0 deg and 10 deg. Second, peak MZ shifts outward as MZ increases. Third, the peaks for positive and negative
                    SA aren't the same (to be safe, I'm going to take all MZ magnitudes at the greater peak). Now I'm going to sweep the 
                    FZ vs SA plot with these constraints in mind. I'll take the maximum total FZ that occurs on 0 &#8804; SA &#8804; 10 
                    deg. I've included this state to the right:

                    Now I need to approximate the MZ for the conditions above. It looks like FZ will shift to around 100 Nm as we approach
                    1500 N. I can include a rigorous analysis of this later, but for now this approximation seems reasonable. Keep in mind
                    that as FZ increases, we also shift the peaks outward. Therefore, I'll approximate both aligning moments as
                    80 Nm or 700 lbf-in. Now I need the corresponding suspension member forces for this state. I've solved for these forces
                    and included them to the right (note that I only need the tie rod forces for this analysis):

                    2. Subtract force from the tie rods (axial force on the tie rods will oppose the direction of the moment)
                    <br>
                    3. Sum forces from the left and right sides of the vehicle
                    <br>
                    4. Convert force on the rack to moment on the column (Force * (C-factor / 2&pi;))

                    These calculations give me a steering effort of 14.7 lbf-ft at the steering wheel, or a force of 17.6 lbf on both
                    sides of the steering wheel. Note that this calculation is done without tire scaling. Scaling will drop the steering
                    effort below 10 lbf-ft and the required force below 10 lbf, but I want a worst case scenario for force calculations, 
                    so I'll use the 14.7 lbf-ft value for now.

                <h2> Column Sizing: </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I know torque throughout the column, I can size the column tubes appropriately. I'll use the following
                    formula for this calculation: shear stress = Tr / Ip. I know the torque through my system from steering effort, and
                    I'll double this torque for a factor of safety (approximate to 40 lbf-ft). I'll opt with steel 4130 for now as our 
                    material (due to its yield strength and our team's familiarity with it). This calculation gives me the following:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    OD / (OD^4 - ID^4) &#8804; 28.634
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also want to minimize mass, so I need to minimize &pi;/4 * (OD^2 - ID^2). I've plotted failure metric vs weight
                    metric to the right. Point 1 corresponds to a tube of outer diameter 0.75" and inner diameter 0.694". I've repeated
                    this process for the upper column as well.

                <p>
                    I now know the torque throughout the steering system, so I can select universal joints that meet my requirements.
                    Note that I will use Misumi to source these u-joints, as they have highly adjustable components and in-depth data
                    sheets. I've gone ahead and located a potential model (the standard model made by Misumi). I'll start at this
                    arbitrary point and look at the selection criteria from the data sheet, listed to the right:

                    Using the given formula, I'll approximate an arbitrary rotational speed as 100 rpm (1.67 revolutions per second).
                    This is technically intermittent speed rather than continuous, but it'll give us a worst case scenario.
                    Our u-joint angle is 25 degrees, and the torque is 40 lbf-ft (55 Nm). This gives a condition variable of 137,500
                    and a corrected rotational speed of 182 rpm. I've selected a u-joint with a condition variable of 175,000 and
                    an allowable rotational speed of 900 (UNCA16). I've now implemented two of these into the design.
